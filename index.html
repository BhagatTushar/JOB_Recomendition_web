                A data scientist uses data to understand and explain the phenomena around them, and help organizations make better decisions.Working as a data scientist can be intellectually challenging, analytically satisfying, and put you at the forefront of new advances in technology. Data scientists have become more common and in demand, as big data continues to be increasingly important to the way organizations make decisions. Here’s a closer look at what they are and do—and how to become one.Data scientists determine the questions their team should be asking and figure out how to answer those questions using data. They often develop predictive models for theorizing and forecasting.
                As part of data science initiatives, data scientists often must work with large amounts of data to develop and test hypotheses, make inferences and analyze things such as customer and market trends, financial risks, cybersecurity threats, stock trades, equipment maintenance needs and medical conditions.
                In businesses, data scientists typically mine data for information that can be used to predict customer behavior, identify new revenue opportunities, detect fraudulent transactions and meet other business needs. They also do valuable analytics work for healthcare providers, academic institutions, government agencies, sports teams and other types of organizations.
                They're commonly tasked with finding information that enables more effective marketing campaigns, improved customer service, stronger supply chain management and better business decisions and strategies overall. To do so, they analyze sets of quantitative and qualitative data, depending on the needs of specific applications.

            <p>
                Network administration aims to manage, monitor, maintain, secure, and service an organization’s network. However, the specific tasks and procedures may vary depending on the size and type of an organization.
                Network monitoring is essential to monitor unusual traffic patterns, the health of the network infrastructure, and devices connected to the network. It helps detect abnormal activity, network issues, or excessive bandwidth consumption early on and take preventative and remedial actions to uphold the network quality and security.
                Network management encompasses multiple administrative functions, including network planning, implementation, and configuration. It involves:

 
<p> 1. replanning the network based on changing organizational requirements
<p> 2. implementing the network for maximum efficiency
<p> 3. configuring various networking and security protocols
<p> 4. applying security patches and updating the firmware of the networking infrastructure, such as routers, hubs, switches, and firewalls
<p> 5. assessing the network for weaknesses
<p> 6. evaluating quality and capacity to increase or decrease network capacity and manage resource wastage.

            <p>
                A systems analyst is an IT professional who works on a high level in an organization to ensure that systems, infrastructures and computer systems are functioning as effectively and efficiently as possible. System analysts carry the responsibilities of researching problems, finding solutions, recommending courses of actions and coordinating with stakeholders in order to meet specified requirements. They study the current system, procedures and business processes of a company and create action plans based on the requirements set.
                Systems analysts need to be familiar with different operating systems, hardware configurations, programming languages, and software and hardware platforms. They can be involved starting from the analysis phase of the project until the post deployment assessment review.
                Systems analysts transform user requests or requirements into technical design specifications and act as a liaison between clients/IT professionals and technology vendors. The main responsibility of systems analysts in the IT industry is to figure out how to solve a problem by linking different computers or systems and to specify what platform, protocols, software, hardware and communications medium can be used to solve that problem.

            <h2> 5.DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR </h2>
            <p>
                Database administrators or managers create and maintain databases compatible with their companies' needs. These information technology (IT) professionals oversee database updates, storage, security, and troubleshooting.
                Database administrators need at least a bachelor's degree in information science or computer science for most entry-level positions. Depending on the size and complexity of their company or governing body, these professionals may need a master's degree in database administration or information technology. All database administrators need fundamental knowledge of structured query language (SQL) and software vendor certifications.
<p>Responsibility for an accurate implementation of control lies with the DBA. Indeed, to gain the full benefits of using a centralized database, you must have a central point of control for it. Because the actual implementation of the DBA function is dependent on a company's organization, we limit ourselves to a discussion of the roles and responsibilities of a DBA. The group fulfilling the DBA role will need experience in both application and systems programming.
